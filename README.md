# 💧 AI Smart Irrigation & Environmental Modeling  
**Machine Learning | Remote Sensing | Water Optimization**

This project explores using machine learning and satellite data (remote sensing)  
to optimize irrigation schedules and improve water consumption efficiency.

---

## 🚀 Objectives
- Predict soil moisture and crop water needs  
- Reduce irrigation water waste  
- Integrate IoT sensors (future)  
- Build environmental ML models (Rainfall, Drought, NDVI, etc.)  

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack
- Python  
- Scikit-Learn / XGBoost  
- Rasterio / GDAL (satellite analysis)  
- NumPy / Pandas  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  

---

## 📊 Example Models
- Rainfall prediction (SVR / Random Forest)  
- NDVI vegetation index analysis  
- Drought detection using anomaly models
